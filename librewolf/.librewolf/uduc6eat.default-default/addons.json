tabs like a tree.","fullDescription":"This extension provides the ability to work with tabs as \"trees\".\n\nNew tabs opened from the current tab are automatically organized as \"children\" of the current tab.\nSuch \"branches\" are easily folded (collapsed) by clicking on the arrow shown in the \"parent\" tab, so you no longer need to suffer from too many visible tabs.\nIf you want, you can restructure the tree via drag and drop.\n\n    Such a tree of tabs will behave like a visual browsing history for you.\n        For example, if you see a list of search results for a topic, each search result link will open in new child tab.\n        New tabs opened from these \"child\" tabs will appear as descendants of their originating tabs.\n        You'll easily dig and dig deeply, without losing your browsing trail - if you want to go back to the original search result, you just have to switch to the \"root\" tab.\n    Moreover, each tree will reflect a group of tabs on a similar topic.\n\n\nPlease enjoy as you like!\n\nTips:\n\n    \"F1\" key toggles the TST sidebar.\n    \"Tree Style Tab\" toolbar button also toggles the sidebar. If it's unnecessary, you can remove it from the toolbar.\n\n\nPermissions:\n\nThis extension needs following permissions to work as expected:\n\n    Required:\n        Access browser tabs: to list both active and non-active tabs in the UI.\n        Access recently closed tabs (access to the session information): to save tree information of tabs (structure, collapsed/expanded state, etc.) to tabs' session information and ask to Firefox to manage them as bundled.\n        Display notifications to you: to present information and navigate users without blocking.\n    Optional:\n        Read and modify bookmarks: to simulate bookmark related commands in the tab context menu. / to detect tabs whether they were opened from bookmarks or not.\n        Access your data for all websites (run scripts on webpages): to detect the Ctrl key is pressed/released and prevent needless expansion of collapsed trees while tab switching with Ctrl-Tab/Ctrl-Shift-Tab.\n        Hide and show browser tabs: just for automated tests, not required on regular use.\n\n\nExtensions extend TST:\n\nTST provides APIs for other extensions.\nSome extemsopms extend the behavior of TST's sidebar panel:\n\n    Multiple Tab Handler allows you to select multiple tabs with long-press on tabs. It also allows you to close mutiple tabs with long-press on the closebox on tabs.\n    TST Active Tab in Collapsed Tree shows a small tab on a collapsed tree as an alias for the last active tab under the tree.\n    TST Auto Group Tabs provides ability to group newly opened tabs automatically in various conditions.\n    TST Auto Sticky Tabs provides ability to stick some state tabs to tab bar edges automatically.\n    TST Bookmarks Subpanel allows you to show a small \"Bookmarks\" sidebar panel below tabs in the TST's sidebar.\n    TST Lock Tree Collapsed allows you to lock arbitrary trees as collapsed. (This was a built-in feature on TST 3.3.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Indent Line provides indent lines like Visual Studio Code's one.\n\n\nAnd there are more helper extensions.","weeklyDownloads":19495,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Piro (piro_or)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/9480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275014.png?modified=1668096516","width":764,"height":540,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275014.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Overview"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275015.png?modified=1668096516","width":415,"height":576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275015.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":288,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Tab context menu compatible to Firefox's native one"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275013.png?modified=1668096516","width":284,"height":372,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275013.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":284,"thumbnailHeight":372,"caption":"Drag and drop to manage tree"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275012.png?modified=1668096516","width":219,"height":223,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275012.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":219,"thumbnailHeight":223,"caption":"Long-press on the new tab button shows the container chooser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275016.png?modified=1668096516","width":226,"height":186,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275016.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":226,"thumbnailHeight":186,"caption":"Right-edge of the new tab button shows the new tab position chooser"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/275/275017.png?modified=1668096516","width":648,"height":567,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/275/275017.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":457,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Various built-in theme"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/237/237255.png?modified=1668096516","width":467,"height":350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/237/237255.jpg?modified=1668096516","thumbnailWidth":467,"thumbnailHeight":350,"caption":"\"Save bookmark\" dialog"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5325,"reviewCount":843,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/reviews/","updateDate":1723445050000},{"id":"{7a7a4a92-a2a0-41d1-9fd7-1e92480d612d}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-32.png?modified=1542603952","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-64.png?modified=1542603952","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/814/814814-128.png?modified=1542603952"},"name":"Stylus","version":"1.5.51","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4338993/styl_us-1.5.51.xpi","homepageURL":"https://add0n.com/stylus.html","supportURL":"https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/","description":"Redesign your favorite websites with Stylus, an actively developed and community driven userstyles manager.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":1878,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6809,"reviewCount":325,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1724320359000},{"id":"{3c6bf0cc-3ae2-42fb-9993-0d33104fdcaf}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2693/2693103-32.png?modified=6d0e70c6","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2693/2693103-64.png?modified=6d0e70c6","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2693/2693103-128.png?modified=6d0e70c6"},"name":"'Improve YouTube!'  🎧 (For YouTube & Video)","version":"4.1096","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4346846/youtube_addon-4.1096.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension/","supportURL":"https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-addon/","description":"Youtube Extension.

In skip-urls-list mode, all URLs for which redirects should be skipped need to be added to the skip-urls-list manually.\n\nSome websites use multiple url parameters like this:\n\n`www.example.com/page-we-want-to-skip?first=www.want-to-go-here.com&second=www.do-not-care-about-this-url.com`\n\nSkip Redirect does not know which is the right parameter, but you can edit the no-skip-parameter-list. Adding `first` would skip to the URL of `second` and vice versa. Adding both, `first` and `second` would cause no skipping.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n--------------\n\nThis extension does not collect or send data of any kind to third parties.\n\nFeedback\n--------\n\nYou can report bugs or make feature requests on https://github.com/sblask/webextension-skip-redirect\n\nPatches are welcome.","weeklyDownloads":347,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Sebastian Blask","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10503078/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162862.png?modified=1622132286","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162862.jpg?modified=1622132286","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"The red \"skip\" above the addons' toolbar icon indicates that a skip of a redirect has happened during the last 3 seconds(the delay is configurable in the addons' preferences)."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162858.png?modified=1622132286","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162858.jpg?modified=1622132286","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"If you hold the mouse pointer above the toolbar icon, details about the original url(the one that got skipped) and the final url are shown."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/162/162864.png?modified=1622132287","width":550,"height":175,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162864.jpg?modified=1622132287","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"Use the toolbar icon to disable(the icon will light grey as in this picture) and enable the skipping."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5655,"reviewCount":89,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-redirect/reviews/","updateDate":1646977894000},{"id":"save-extension@omnivore.app","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2713/2713655-32.png?modified=c654f18c","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2713/2713655-64.png?modified=c654f18c","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2713/2713655-128.png?modified=c654f18c"},"name":"Omnivore","version":"2.10.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4246656/omnivore-2.10.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://omnivore.app/","supportURL":"https://omnivore.app/feedback","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/omnivore/","description":"Omnivore is the read-it-later app for serious readers.
